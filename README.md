# HackerRank-Xerox-Challenge

##### The aim of this challenge was to predict the risk of death (mortality) in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) within hospitals.

##### I used a gaussian model. Values for any features that lies outside the 2nd standrad deviation of the mean considered as a threshold which decides whether a person has lived or died. Then a scikit-learn logistic regression predictor was used to classify.

##### finalScript.ipynb => script which was submitted to the competition.

##### Xerox_Challenge.ipynb & run_model.ipynb => both are trial scripts.
